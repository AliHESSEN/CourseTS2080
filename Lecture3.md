-- What is UML
* general-purpose visual modeling language
* specify, visualize, construct, and document the artifacs of a software system
* understand, design, browse , configure, maintain, and control information about such systems

	Is UML  a standard?

-	Create the diagram before you start the project
-	It is not a standard process, but is intended to be useful with an iterative development process.
-	UML is not a programming language, but can be used to write programs
-	It is a general-purpose modelling language for GUI layout, VLSI circuit design.
-	It also can be used to unite different programming languages. It is used to simplify and consolidate the large number of oop development methods
-	The higher risk, the higher chance of having a programming standard. (like the health industry or defence industry will most likely have a standard way of programming the software

•	Is UML enforced?
-	No, it is not.
-	It was originally for oop.
-	Commonly accepted concepts from many oop methods.
-	The UML is intended to model most application domains

•	Benefits of UML
-	Quick understanding from one programming language to another
-	UML is abstraction
-	Simplify systems
-	Independent of technology used
-	System handover


•	Type of UML Diagrams
-	Class
-	Timing
-	Object 
-	Profile
-	Component
-	Deployment
-	Two families of UML diagrams : structure and behaviour 
-	The structure part will show you the thing, and the behaviour will tell you about it and how it workings
-	The different diagram allow for modelling a system from several separate, but related viewpoints permit it to be understood.

•	In Behavioural
-	Use Diagram
-	Activity diagram
-	Sequence diagram

UML is modelling language, not a description of a detailed development process
UML is not the code in boxes and arrows. Its not another way to look at the code, it is a another way to describe the code.

•	Legends of map
-	Describes how to read the map or diagram. With what the different things in the diagram means

•	Complexity of UML #1
-	Class can interact with different classes in a lot of ways.
-	UML is product of consensus of persons with varied goals and interests. T share the qualities of the product of a democratic process
-	UML is not as clean or coherent as the product of a single will
-	It contains superfluous features (but different persons might disagree about precisely what is superfluous)
-	Contains overlapping features that not always well integrated

•	Complexity of UML #2
-	Tension between concepts for conceptual modelling and programming language representation, with no consistent guidelines


UML is more than a visual notation. UML models can be used to generate code and test cases


What is OO analysis and Design?

-	Identify objects (finne ut hva skal programmet skal gjøre/ha  for å fungere slik man øsnker)
-	Define relationships
-	Establish Interface
-	Making design executable
