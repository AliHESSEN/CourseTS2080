## What is object oriented programming?

oop is a concept of programming for dta and objects

## What are the basic concepts of OOP?

a logic of how the data should be manipulated.Its basically about how to manipulate data. Reuseability

## What are the main principles of OOP?

polymorphisim, abstractions, inheritance, encapsulation. We can also manipulate data that way.

## Encapsulation

Multiple things that belong togheter, but are not the same tihng. Like a car. A car can have differnt engine, gearbox,wheel, color etc.. so they are differnet, but they are all the same class (car). 

Private is that not all classes have acces to them.It means that its only useable from within that class. But protected gives permission to a class that inheritance from that class to use it.

why use encapsulation?

-protec the data
- limit access
-securtiy
-Data hiding
-simplicity
-Aesthetics


## Abstraction

Abstraction is providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding their background details. Hiding the unwanted information

## Inheritance

Inheritance is When creating a class, instead of writing completely new data members and member functions, the programmer can designate that the new class should inherit the members of an existing class. This existing class is called the base class, and the new class is referred to as the derived class

## Polymorphism

polymorphism as the ability of a an object to have more than one form. It means that same entity can behave differently in different scenarios
